Bunbase is built around three primitives:

- **Actions**: typed business logic units.
- **Modules**: grouping and shared policy boundaries.
- **Triggers**: invocation adapters (API, cron, event, webhook, MCP).

Read each section:

- [Actions](/docs/core/actions)
- [Modules](/docs/core/modules)
- [Triggers](/docs/core/triggers)
