description: Triggers define how actions are invoked.

A single action can be exposed through different trigger types.

## API trigger

```ts
triggers.api('POST', '/tasks')
```

## Cron trigger

```ts
triggers.cron('0 * * * *')
```

## Event trigger

```ts
triggers.event('task.created')
```

## Webhook trigger

```ts
triggers.webhook('/webhooks/stripe')
```

## MCP trigger

```ts
triggers.mcp('create-task')
```

Use trigger combinations carefully and keep action handlers idempotent when possible.
