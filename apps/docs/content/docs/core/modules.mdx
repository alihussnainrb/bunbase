Modules are optional, but they become useful once your app grows.

```ts
import { guards, module } from 'bunbase'
import { createInvoice } from './create-invoice'
import { listInvoices } from './list-invoices'

export default module({
  name: 'billing',
  description: 'Invoice and billing operations',
  apiPrefix: '/billing',
  guards: [guards.authenticated(), guards.hasFeature('billing')],
  actions: [createInvoice, listInvoices],
})
```

## Why modules

- Shared guard pipelines.
- Shared API namespace via `apiPrefix`.
- Cleaner package boundaries for large projects.
