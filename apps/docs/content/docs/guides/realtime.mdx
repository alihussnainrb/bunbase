description: Enable Bunbase WebSocket support for push updates.

Enable realtime transport in `bunbase.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'bunbase'

export default defineConfig({
  realtime: {
    enabled: true,
    path: '/ws',
    maxConnections: 5000,
  },
})
```

During development, Bunbase logs the realtime endpoint:

```txt
WebSocket: ws://0.0.0.0:3000/ws
```

## Recommendations

- Keep connection limits explicit.
- Use events to decouple producers and subscribers.
- Authenticate sockets when exposing private streams.
